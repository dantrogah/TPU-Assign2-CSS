        <h2>Brief about the Children's Day</h2>
        <div class="about-text">
          <p>
            ​Children's Day is a global observance dedicated to promoting the
            rights and well-being of children. The concept originated in the
            19th century, with Reverend Dr. Charles Leonard holding a special
            service for children in 1856. Internationally, the United Nations
            established Universal Children's Day on November 20, 1954, to
            promote children's rights and welfare.
          </p>
          <p>
            In Ghana, Children's Day is celebrated on November 20 each year. The
            Evangelical Presbyterian Church, Ghana (EPCG), aligns with this
            national observance by organizing activities that emphasize the
            spiritual, educational, and social development of children within
            the church community. These celebrations typically include special
            church services, educational programs, and recreational activities
            designed to honor and nurture the younger members of the
            congregation.​
          </p>
          <p>
            The EPCG's commitment to Children's Day reflects a broader
            dedication to fostering a supportive environment for children,
            ensuring they receive guidance and opportunities to grow in their
            faith and personal development.​
          </p>
          <p>
            This year, the Children's Day celebration took place on March 16,
            2025, at the Accra International Conference Center. The event was
            attended by children, their parents, guardians, and other family
            members, along with the Children’s Service teachers who diligently
            prepared the children for the occasion.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Children’s Ministry consists of various departments, including
            the Prayer Force, Drama Troupe, Choreography Group, Bible Quiz
            Group, Sword Drill Team, and Memory Verse Boxing Team, among others.
            Currently, five teachers oversee the children's service: Mr. Michael
            Opong, Mrs. Lucy Adjei, Miss Jemima Anang, and Mr. Daniel Quaye.
