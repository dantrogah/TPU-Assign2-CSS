      <h2>How to Cook Plain Rice (Step-by-Step Guide)</h2>
      <p>
        Plain rice is a simple but essential dish that can be served with
        various stews, sauces, or soups. Here’s how to prepare it perfectly:
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li>
          Pour the rice into a bowl and rinse it with clean water 2–3 times to
          remove excess starch.
        </li>
        <li>Drain the water and set the washed rice aside.</li>
        <li>
          In a pot, bring 4 cups of water to a boil over medium-high heat.
        </li>
        <li>
          Add salt (if using) and oil or butter (optional, for a non-sticky
          texture).
        </li>
        <li>Pour the washed rice into the boiling water.</li>
        <li>
          Stir once to distribute the rice evenly, then reduce the heat to
          medium-low.
        </li>
        <li>
          Cover the pot with a tight-fitting lid and let the rice cook for about
          15–20 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
          After 15 minutes, check if the water has been absorbed and the rice is
          soft.
        </li>
        <li>
          If the rice is still hard, add a little hot water (if necessary) and
          cook for a few more minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
          Once the rice is fully cooked, turn off the heat and let it sit
          covered for about 5 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>Use a fork to fluff the rice to separate the grains.</li>
      </ol>
