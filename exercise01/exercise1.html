    <h1>Welcome to Introduction to CSS</h1>
    <p>
      CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a stylesheet language used to control the
      presentation and layout of HTML documents. It allows developers to apply
      styles such as colors, fonts, spacing, and positioning to web pages,
      ensuring a visually appealing and consistent design across different
      devices and screen sizes. CSS works by selecting HTML elements and
      applying rules that define how they should be displayed. It supports
      various styling techniques, including inline, internal, and external
      stylesheets, and offers advanced features like Flexbox, Grid, and media
      queries for responsive design.
